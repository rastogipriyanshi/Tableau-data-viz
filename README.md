# Economic Analysis of India, USA and China based on some factors

The data visualization created illustrates the economic changes of three countries India, USA and China over the period of 7 years from 2015 to 2021 based on the factors-
1.General Government Net Lending/Borrowing
2.Current Account Balance
3.Gross Domestic Product (GDP)
This data visualization is done using Tableau Public.

## 1) General Government Net Lending/Borrowing -
* Net Lending(+)/Net Borrowing(-) is calculated as revenue minus total expenditure. This is a core GFS balance that measures the extent to which general government is either putting financial resources at the disposal of other sectors in the economy and non residents(net lending)
* Utilizing the financial resources generated by other sectors and non residents(net borrowing).
* The chart created to illustrate this is a __waterfall chart__ and the data was gathered from the official site of IMF(International Monetary Fund).
#### INSIGHTS
* The visaulization depicts that from 2015 to 2018 India had the highest net borrowing rate compared to USA and China. There is positive scenario seen in 2020 where USA has taken India's position, then comes China and India has the lowest borrowing rate -7.4% (of GDP).
This shall continue for India in 2021 as well based on the data. But China is expected to have higher borrowing rate i.e. 
-9.6% (of GDP) than USA, -8.6% (of GDP).  
* The year 2020 is worst for USA as it recorded to have the highest net borrowing rate,-15.4% (of GDP) since 2015 compared to China and India Thus it is depicted with the darkest shade in the illustration.

## 2) Current Account Balance -
* The current account records a nation's transactions with the rest of the world-specifically its net trade in goods and services, its net earnings on cross-border investments, and its net transfer payments over a defined period of time.
* The current account may be positive (a surplus) or negative (a deficit), positive means the country is a net exporter and negative means it is a net importer of goods and services.
* The chart created to illustrate this is a __line chart__ and the data was collected from the official site of IMF(International Monetary Fund).
#### INSIGHTS
* The graph shows the fluctuations in the rate od current account balance for China and USA since 2015. China was doing the best in 2015 with a value of 2.7% (of GDP) and then showed a drop (1.8%>1.6%>0.4%) after that for over 3 years. In 2019, they showed an increement of 0.6% (of GDP) which is commendable. The pandemic in 2020 again faced a decreement and now their rate is 0.5% (of GDP). The year 2021 is clearly lucky for the country to  reach 1.0%
* China is the only country we see in comparison to India and USA to have positive rate values since 2015 to 2021 which shows the country is a net exporter.
* USA got the peak negative rate of current account balance in 2016 and the same value in 2020 again i.e. -0.6% (of GDP). The value is expected to go down in 2021,-1.4% (of GDP) which is a sign of hope for the country. The country has all negative values which means it is a net importer of goods and services. In 2021 it will import less than the year 2020. 
* USA imported the least in 2018 whereas China exported the least in 2020.
* India shows a linear graph with very less fluctuations over the course of 7 years. It imported the most in 2015, 2.2% (of GDP) and is expected to import the least in 2021, -2.8% (of GDP). 
* The rate was same in 2016, 2017 and 2019 with a value of -2.3% (of GDP) for India.

## 3) Gross Domestic Product(GDP) -
* It is the monetary value of all finished goods and services made within a country during a specific period.
* It provdides an economic snapshot of a country, used to estimate the size of an economy and growth rate.
* The chart created to illustrate this is a __column chart__ and the data was gathered from the site of Trading Economics.
#### INSIGHTS
* It is clear from the illustration that India has the least GDP and USA has the highest.
* The growth is seen in the GDP of India and China from 2015 to 2021 with no drop in the values whereas USA showed a drop in the GDP value in 2020 and went down from 21,200B (US$) to 19,949B (US$).

## 4) International Competitiveness -
* The ratio of the current account balance to the Gross Domestic Product or (% of GDP) provides an indicator of the country's level of international competitiveness. 
* The chart created to illustrate this is a __stacked column chart__ and the values depicted in the graph are the ratio values in US billion dollars.
#### INSIGHTS
* From the graph, it shows China is the most competitive and India is least.
